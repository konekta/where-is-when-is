<h1>Konekta is a web service that supports the collection, validation and access to community based services.</h1>


<h2>About the project</h2>

<p>We are focused on three major user groups:</p>

<h2>A mobile user looking for services nearby.</h2>

<h3>Example user story:</h3>
<h3>'As a young mother I would like to know which community services are available in my area.'</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The service is made available through our mobile client.</p>

<h2>The development practitioner interested in sharing and validating locations.</h2>

<h3>Example user story:</h3>
<h3>'As a development practitioner I would like to share and validate open data so that others find the service.'</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The service is made available through the website <a href="{% url world_location_add %}">location upload form</a> and publication to an <a href="http://thedatahub.org/dataset/geolocations-for-community-development" target="_blank">open database</a>.</p>

<h2>The developer interested in developing applications that use this data.</h2>

<h3>Example user story:</h3>
<h3>'As a developer I need access to reliable data so that I can build applications.'</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The service is made available through the JSON web service.</p>

<h2>'Mobile services are primarily about linking â€“ connecting people to information, services, and people who can help. If there are not adequate services, systems, or trained people to connect to, then mobile services are weak.'</h2>

<p>Peter Benjamin - Managing Director of Cell Life</p>
